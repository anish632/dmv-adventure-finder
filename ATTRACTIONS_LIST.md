## How the App Works

The app now uses **randomized selection** to show variety:
- Instead of always showing the first few Smithsonian museums, it randomly selects from the entire database
- Each search will show different combinations of museums and attractions
- Mix of both famous (Smithsonian) and lesser-known gems (like O Street Museum, Textile Museum, etc.)
