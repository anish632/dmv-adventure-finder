    - Location: ${location}
    - Time of Day: ${time}
    - Budget: ${budget}

    Focus on creative, non-cliche ideas that go beyond typical tourist activities. For example:
    - Instead of "visit a museum," suggest "create a photo story using only reflections in museum windows"
    - Instead of "go to a restaurant," suggest "build your own picnic from 3 different food trucks and find the perfect spot"
    - Instead of "walk in the park," suggest "create a sound map of the park using only natural sounds"

    Make suggestions that are:
    - Creative and unique
    - Interactive and engaging
    - Memorable and shareable
    - Accessible for the given budget

    Return the response as a JSON array with the following structure:
    [
